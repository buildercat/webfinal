			<h2>Our History</h2>
			<p>We were founded in 2019 after our founder, John Smith, went to Africa with a group for a humanitarian aid project. When he was there, he saw the poverty they lived in, and the lack of basic resources available to them. With the help from a few members of the group that he was in, he founded this organization.</p>
			<h2>The Problem</h2>
			<ul class="bullet">
				<li>&bull; 115 people in Africa die every hour from diseases related to contaminated water and poor sanitation.</li>
				<li>&bull; Countries such as Algeria have a 40.8% unemployment rate</li>
				<li>&bull; Seven out of 10 Rural Youth have never attended school, and of the 49 million students in secondary schools, only 6% of those are working towards a technical and vocational skill.</li>
			</ul>
			<h2>How we have been working to solve it</h2>
			<p>After the creation of our organization in 2019, we began our work in early 2021, delivering solar water heaters to poorer regions of Africa, where we trained them to use the heater to boil the water to remove diseases. We also began training of several groups of unemployed groups in maintenance and installation of solar panels until they were able to continue our work in other local villages without assistance. Our training also provided vocational skills needed to help people get jobs and manage technical businesses with limited resources primarily focus around renewable resources. We also successfully completed construction of solar arrays in several towns, all powering their schools for the first time, offering many more education opportunities.</p>

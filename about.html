			<h2>Our History</h2>
			<p>We were founded in 2019 after our founder, John Smith, went to Africa with a group for a humanitarian aid project. When he was there, he saw the poverty they lived in, and the lack of basic resources available to them. With the help from a few member of the group that he was in, he founded this organization.</p>
			<h2>The Problem</h2>
			<p>Hospitals in Africa don't have power to keep medicines cool, children don't have light to do schoolwork at night, and schools don't have power to keep the lights on while providing an education that will get them far in life.</p>
			<h2>How we have been working to solve it</h2>
